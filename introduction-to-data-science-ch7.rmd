# From problem to model building 

In this section we will cover :
- mapping problems to machine learning models 
- evaluate the quality and effectiveness of models 

The first section will provide an overview of the basic problems that can be solved 
with data science and how to choose the right type of model for the given problem. 

We will then evaluate if a model is performing well enough for the 
needs of the project.
It takes great experience and insigt to know how to translate problem (question) to 
a usable model :

# Data science questions

There are common questions that are common to seek answers in data science :

# Business problems

Common world business problems that are usually solved with data science :

- Predict which products a customer might buy
- Detect fraud
- Calculate price elasticity
- Product search engine
- Customer segmentation
- Optimizing how much to spend in AdWords
- Evaluating marketing campaigns
- Organizing new products into a product catalog
# Main types of models
## Classification 

Classification can be done betweek two categories (binomial) or multiple categories. One evident business problem 
solved by classification is *Product Categorization*

Some of the most popular classification methods are :

### naive Bayes 

- good with multi-level input categories
- product categorization
- text classification

### Decision trees
- if-then situations
- redundent and correlated inputs
- easier to interpret

### Logistic regression
- class probabilities
- probability of fraud
- probability sensitivity analysis

### Support vector machines 
- many input variables
- input correlated with outcome
- less asumptions about input distributions

## Scoring (regression)

### linear regression 
- predicts numerical trends 
- prediction is linear addition of numeric inputs
- relative impact of each input variable on the output
- often good first guess
- distribution of input variables matter
- input variables need not be correlated

## logistic regression
- predicts 0 or 1
- predicting probabilities of categories -> scoring

## Clustering (unsupervised)
Unsupervised learning : Custering can be used when no outcomes are known (missing or non-existing yet). 
It can help discovering patterns and relationships in the data. Some common clustering methods are : 

### K-means clustering (unknown groups)

### Association rules (Apriori)
- Identify strong rules
- Ex: Predict products that are usually bought together 
- Useful for recommendations

### Nearest neighbor
- Another method applicable for recommendations
- Observe the behavior of others that are most similar (nearest) to the subject under study
- Make a prediction for the subject

# Otokorelasyon: üç obje var bunlardan ikisi birbirine daha yakın. birbirlerine daha yakın olanların birbirine daha yakın olma olasılıgı 
# fazladır.

# otokorelasyon olmayan bir örnek: bir orman var bu ormanın icindeki görebilecegimiz orman sayısı.bir taraftan su geçiyo diger taraftan gecmiyo.su gecmeyen alanda daha az hayvan var. birbirine benzeyemiyo.cünkü arada cit var .
